Special Thanks
--------------
This is a list of all those who have contributed code to pyBigBuy in some way, shape, or form. I think it's
exhaustive, but I could be wrong - if you think your name should be here and it's not, please contact
me and let me know (or just issue a pull request on GitHub, and leave a note about it so I can just accept it ;).
